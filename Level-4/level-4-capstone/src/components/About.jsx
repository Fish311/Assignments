                    The Fellowship is a group of 9 people from various races of Middle-Earth tasked with destroying the one ring.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Fellowship was formed in the elven city of Rivendell, the house of Elrond.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Fellowhsip consisted of 2 men, 1 elf, 1 dwarf, 1 wizard, and 4 hobbits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most of them knew the journey was doomed from the start, but took it as the last chance to save Middle-Earth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Their destination was Mount Doom, the only place where the ring could be destroyed. And it was in the middle of the enemy's lair.
